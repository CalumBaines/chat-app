# Vue Chat Application

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve at localhost:8080
$ npm run serve

```

## Setup Server

``` bash
# CD into server folder
$ cd server

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start server at localhost:8081
$ npm start

```
Both the server and front end must be running at the same time for the application to work correctly.

Using [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) as frontend framework, [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create the server and [Socket IO](https://socket.io/) to easily communicate between the front end and the server.
